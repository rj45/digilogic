# digilogic

digilogic is a digital circuit simulator similar to [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) and [LogiSim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).

## Status

This project is just beginning. Please consider contributing.

It's built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

## Goals

Eventually a viable alternative to to [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) and [LogiSim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).

Initial focus will be on making a visual, aesthetically pleasing digital circuit simulator that can have circuits exported to verilog to run on an FPGA. (Later this will be expanded to discrete 7400 series builds.)

See the [issues](https://github.com/rj45/digilogic/issues) for features and feature requests. Please add thumbs to vote for any features you want to see!
